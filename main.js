Frogland

        In Frogland there are a diverse range of frogs. Due to the perfect climate conditions they thrive, BUT
    there is one challenge the frogs must face each year.

        The frogs must cross Frogland to access richer ponds as the season changes. On this path are THREE rivers
    the frogs must cross to survive the rest of the year, and it is up to you to calculate HOW MANY FROGS REMAIN
    from this tortuous journey.

        Each type of frog has evolved differently, therefore they have different strengths at swimming. This means
    there are different DEATH RATES for the frogs when crossing each river.

    Brown Frog -    This dull coloured frog thrives in low water levels and loves splashing in muddy patches. They are
                    poor swimmers resulting in them having an 8% DEATH RATE when crossing a river.

    Green Frog -    Smaller and more energetic, these frogs like jumping through tall grass. This gives them great
                    legs which they use for swimming strongly. Still they have a 5% DEATH RATE when crossing a river.

    Gold Frog -     Finally these shiny and beautiful frogs are natures finest. They can jump high and swim the
                    strongest. They are safe in the knowledge that they have a 1% DEATH RATE when crossing a river.

        Now you know your frogs, given a random number of Brown, Green and Golden frogs, calculate how many survive
    the crossing of the three rivers.

        No half frogs survive, so if your TOTAL number comes to a floating point, it should be rounded up to an
        integer as that partial frog will not survive. There will alway at least 1 or each frog type and there are
        no negative frogs.
